Demo : [Storybook Component](https://static-ui-storybook.netlify.app/?path=/story/button--primary-button)

## Part2
Create a simple UI with the rendered svg image and a slider beneath to control the strength of the Arch effect.

Demo : [Storybook Component](https://static-ui-storybook.netlify.app/?path=/story/arc-transformation--arc-transformation-for-svg)

Approach : Implemented arc tranformation by drawing the image pixel by pixel and by applying a offset on the Y axis.
No frameworks have been used. Done purely with Javascript using React.
